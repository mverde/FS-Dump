CS111 Lab3b		5/20/16

- Zhaoxing angry about Lab 3
- sample output is the only correct source to figure out what you're supposed to
  output; otherwise confusing
- 3b should be easier than 3a b/c
  - can choose any programming language (Python)
  - took fewer hours for Zhaoxing to understand what to do

Sample solution initializes two lists: inodeBitmapBlocks and block
inodeFreeList	lists
blockFreeList

inodeAllocated	dict:<num, object>
blockAllocated

indirectTable	(block<num, entrynum, ptr>)
directoryTable	(entryinode, parentinode)

class Inode: inode number, parent inode, referenced by list:<dirinode, entrynum>
      	     num_links, ptrs (list)

class Block: block number, referenced by list<inodenum, indirectblocknum, entry>
      	     	   	   (these variables for each element)

# of hard links to directories should be: 2+numsubdirectories (. and ..)
